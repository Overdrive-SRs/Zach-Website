<h1 class="important">Recent History of Presidential Elections in America</h1>
<p>Presidential elections can show how politics change over time. I believe that using the time period of 2000 - 2020 gives a good idea of where politics is at. I chose this topic of presidential elections because not only does it interest me in general, it also is intriguing to look into how the landscape is ever changing in America. With this narrative I was looking to answer the question of how things have changed in the last 20 years, at least in a consolidated part of America. I chose to look into the Northwest region of the United States as it's where I've lived the vast majority of my life, and is worth looking into. I collected the data for my narrative by going to different election results pages on Wikipedia and following the citations to their sources where the original election data can be found. Using the data that I collected, some conclusions can be made. One conclusion is the fact that turnout in elections has increased over the years. This makes sense with population growth.</p>

<div id="div_1">
<p class="highlight">It can be concluded that 2020 had an especially high turnout compared to previous elections, which may be for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Covid-19 pandemic caused many people to make the decision to vote by mail, and some states extended deadlines for receiving mail-in ballots, which allowed many mail-in ballots received long after election day to be counted, which normally would not have been counted.</li>
  <li>The media for both sides of the political spectrum worked harder than ever to rally people behind their candidate. Because of the insane amount of media attention politics and the 2020 election were getting, people were less likely to sit out the election on the sidelines.</li>
  <li>Some people viewed the sitting president's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic itself to be inadequate. So, people were inclined to vote for the other popular candidate.</li>
</ul> 

<div id="div_1">
<p>There were gains in voter turnout across every state, ranging from rural, to suburban, to urban areas. Based on the data, it can also be concluded that none of the states in the Northwest region of America are swing states; that is, states that can flip either way, and are critical for deciding the winner of the election overall.</p>

<p class="highlight">The following bar graph showing the popular vote totals over the entirety of the 21st century for the two major parties supports the fact that the 2020 election had extremely high turnout:</p>

<p class="highlight">The following graphs show the margins of victory for parties' candidates in the 21st century in the Northwest region of the United States. The data makes it easy to see the change in vote share over time:</p>

<h1><img src='OREGON change.png' class="responsive"></h1>
<h1><img src='WASHINGTON change.png' class="responsive"></h1>
<h1><img src='WYOMING change.png' class="responsive"></h1>



<p class="highlight">Since the year 2000, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington have shifted to the left, and Wyoming has shifted to the right. Conclusions can be made about why this is the case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The growth of each states' big cities may have led to a shift to the left.</li>
  <li>Certain states' new laws concerning certain issues may have led to people moving to those states. For example, Oregon decriminalized drugs, which may have led to
those in agreement with such a law to move to the state, thus making the state head more in that direction.</li>
  <li>Wyoming, being the odd one out, is an extremely rural state. So much so, that it's possible that those looking for a new rural life, likely
those that are leaning right, may move to the state and continue a rightward trend in the state.</li>
</ul> 

<p class="highlight">There are possibly endless conclusions that can be made, but it's important to note that those are some of the main reasons behind some of the shifts.</p>
